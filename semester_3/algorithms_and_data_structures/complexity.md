# complexity

Defined relative to the size of input

## space complexity

The peak asymptotic space (memory) needed in an algorithm.

## time complexity

The asymptotic time (operations) needed in an algorithm.

Base unit of operations are the elementary operations.

### dominating instruction

A set of instructions for which their asymptotic running time is equal to the asymptotic running time of the whole algorithm.

### cases

- Worst-case: the worst time complexity for a specific input
- Average-case: the average time complexity from all inputs
