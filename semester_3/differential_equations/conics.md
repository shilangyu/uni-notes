## ellipse

Described by a set of points in the plane for which the sum of distances from two fixed points (called foci $F$, $F'$) is constant.

$$
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
$$

## hyperbola

Described by a set of points in the plane for which the difference of distances from two fixed points (called foci $F$, $F'$) is constant.

$$
\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
$$

## parabola

Described by a set of points in the plane for which the distances from a fixed point (called focus) and a fixed line (called the directrix) are equal.

$$
y = \frac{1}{4c}x^2
$$

Where $f = (0, c)$ and the directrix by the $x$-axis
