# fields

Set of elements with defined addition and multiplication: $(\mathbb{F}, +, \cdot)$ It has to be comply the following rules:

- Associativity of addition and multiplication: $a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$, and $a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c$
- Commutativity of addition and multiplication: $a + b = b + a$, and $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$
- Additive and multiplicative identity: there exist two different elements $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1}$ in $\mathbb{F}$ such that $a + \mathbf{0} = a$ and $a \cdot \mathbf{1} = a$
- Additive inverses: for every $a$ in $\mathbb{F}$, there exists an element in $\mathbb{F}$, denoted $−a$, called the additive inverse of $a$, such that $a + (−a) = 0$
- Multiplicative inverses: for every $a \ne 0$ in $\mathbb{F}$, there exists an element in $\mathbb{F}$, denoted by $a^{−1}$ or $\frac{1}{a}$, called the multiplicative inverse of $a$, such that $a \cdot a^{−1} = 1$
- Distributivity of multiplication over addition: $a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)$

### groups vs rings vs fields

- group has a defined addition and subtraction
- ring has a defined addition, subtraction, and multiplication
- field has a defined addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (however addition and multiplication is enough as the other ones can be defined using these)
