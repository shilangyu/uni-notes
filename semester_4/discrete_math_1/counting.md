## k-permutations of n-element set

$n^{\underline k} = \binom{n}{k}k! = \frac{n!}{(n - k)!}$

## Stirling number

Let $N$ be a set and have partitions denoted by $A_i$ ($i \le k$).

$\Pi(N)$ is the family of all such partitions of $N$

The Stirling number $S_{n,k} = {n \brace k}$ is the number of all k-partitions of an $n$-set

## Bell number

$B_n = \sum_k S_{n,k}$
