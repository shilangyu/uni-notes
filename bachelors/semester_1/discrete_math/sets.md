# sets

Expressed with capital letters or list of elements between braces:

$A = \{ a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n \}$ where $n$ is the size of the set

Two sets are considered equal when all the elements are the same

We consider subsets of some universal $X$, $A, B, \cdots \in 2^X =$ the set of all subsets of $X$:

let: $X = \{ a, b, c \}$ then $2^X = \{ \emptyset, \{ a \}, \{ b \}, \{ c \}, \{ b, c \}, \{ a, b \}, \{ a, c \}, \{ a, b, c \} \}$

$|2^X| = 2^{|X|}$

$2^X = p(X)$, also: $p_k(X)$ is a set of sets of length $k$

#### declarations

- $A \subseteq B$: Every element of A is an element of B
- $A \subsetneq B$: Every element of A is an element of B but not equal to each other
- $a \in B$: a is an element of B

#### De Morgan's law

$\bigcup\limits_{t \in T}(\mathbb{R} - A_t) = \mathbb{R} - \bigcap\limits_{t \in T} A_t$

#### operations on sets

Assumption: $x \in X$

- union: $A \cup B = x \in A \lor x \in B$
- intersection: $A \cap B = x \in A \land x \in B$
- difference: $A - B = x \in A \land x \notin B$[^1]
- symmetric difference: $A \div B = (A - B) \cup (B - A)$
- complement: $A' = x \notin A$
- cartesian product: $\{1, 2\} \times \{3, 4, 5\} = \{(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)\}$
- union of sets: $\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{n} S_i$
- intersection of sets: $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^{n} S_i$

[^1]: $x \notin A \equiv \neg(x \in A)$
