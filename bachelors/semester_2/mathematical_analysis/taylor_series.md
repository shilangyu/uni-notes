# Taylor series

Taylor series are power series generated from a function $f$

## constructing a series

For $x = a$ then $a_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}$

Then if $f$ has a series representation it must be:

$$
	f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x - a)^2 + \cdots
$$

## Maclaurin series

If the series are centered around $a = 0$ we call the generated power series Maclaurin series.

## order of n

Tells us about the 'deepness'. How many derivatives we are taking (instead of abstract $\infty$). $n$ is then called the order of the Taylor series.

$$
	P_n(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x - a)^2 + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x - a)^n
$$

## Taylor theorem

Let $R_n$ be the remainder (error)

$f(x) = P_n(x) + R_n(x)$

Let $I$ be an interval, $x, a \in I$ there is a number $c$ between $x$ and $a$ then $R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}(x - a)^{n+1}$

If $\lim_{n \to \infty} R_n = 0$ for all $x \in I$ the Taylor series generated by $f$ at $x = a$ converges to $f$ on $I$.
