## environments

### dispersion

Dispersion occurs when electromagnetic properties, such as permittivity, permeability or conductivity, vary with frequency.

### dielectrics

A material is called dielectric if it reacts with an external electric field $E$. Then the polarization density $P$ is: $\vec P = \epsilon_0 \chi_e \vec E$.

We say a material is conductive if it allows electrons/ions to flow through it.

#### losses

Losses are quantified with a _loss tangent_: $\epsilon_r = \epsilon_r'(1 - j\tan \delta)$

However if losses have conductive behavior then: $\epsilon_r = \epsilon_r'j\frac{\sigma}{\omega \epsilon_0}$

### electric susceptibility

$\chi_e$ is electric susceptibility, it can be expressed in terms of relative permittivity: $\epsilon_r = 1 + \chi_e$. Therefore: $\vec D = \epsilon_0(1+\chi_e)\vec E$

## wavefront

Surface of equal phase, for example a spherical wave

## plane wave

Approximation of a real wave.

When we move far from the source of a spherical wave, the wave becomes approximately straight.

Let $\vec k$ be the normal unit vector of the plane wave. Let $\vec r$ be the distance from source Then $\vec r \vec k - vt = const$.

### phase

$\beta = \frac{\omega}{v} = \omega\sqrt{\mu \epsilon}$

(in radians): $\phi = \omega t - \vec \beta \vec r = - \beta (\vec r \vec k - vt) = const$

### properties

A plane wave is a transverse electromagnetic wave (TEM)

1. Velocity $v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu \epsilon}}$
2. Orthogonal vectors $\vec E = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\epsilon}}\vec H \times \vec k$ and $\vec H = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{\mu}}\vec k \times \vec E$
3. Impedance $Z_w = \frac{E_\perp}{H_\perp} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\epsilon}}$
