## ellipse

Described by a set of points in the plane for which the sum of distances from two fixed points (called foci $F$, $F'$) is constant.

$$
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
$$

Foci are located at:

$$
\begin{cases}
	(\pm c, 0) & \text{if} & a > b \\
	(0, \pm c) & \text{if} & a < b \\
\end{cases}
$$

Where $c = \sqrt{|a^2 - b^2|}$

## hyperbola

Described by a set of points in the plane for which the difference of distances from two fixed points (called foci $F$, $F'$) is constant.

Let $c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$

### Foci on x axis

#### equation

$\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$

#### foci

$(\pm c, 0)$

### Foci on y axis

#### equation

$\frac{y^2}{b^2} - \frac{x^2}{a^2} = 1$

#### foci

$(0, \pm c)$

## parabola

Described by a set of points in the plane for which the distances from a fixed point (called focus) and a fixed line (called the directrix) are equal.

### Focus on x axis

$$
x = \frac{1}{4c}y^2
$$

$F = (c, 0)$

**Directrix**: $x = -c$

### Focus on y axis

$$
y = \frac{1}{4c}x^2
$$

$F = (0, c)$

**Directrix**: $y = -c$
