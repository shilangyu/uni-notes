## context free languages (CFL) - properties

- CFL is closed under _union_, _concatenation_, and _Kleene closure_
- CFL is not closed under _intersection_ and _complement_

## CFL $\subset$ CSL

CSL's normal form where $\delta_1 = \delta_2 = \epsilon$ is a context free grammar.

<!--
HOMEWORK:
  - prove {a^m b^m c^m d^m : m > 0} is not context free and prove it is context sensitive
  - prove { uu : u \in {a,b}^* } is not context free and prove it is context sensitive
