R test: 24-25.01

## descriptive statistics

Deals with collecting,

- **Population**: complete collection of all items of interest
- **Sample**: observed subset of the population. Denoted by $x_1, x_2, \dots x_n$ where is a sample size
- **Parameter**: characteristic of a population (fixed)
- **Statistic**: specific characteristic of a sample. Estimator is a statistic which we wish to be close to the parameter of interest
- **Variable**: characteristic of an individual

## classification

- categorical
  - ordinal: can be ordered
  - nominal: cannot be ordered
- numerical
  - discrete: set of possible values, often integers
  - continuous: range of possible values, often floats

## frequency distribution

- For categorical data, columns are in the following order: Classes (ordered), amount, frequency, cumulative amount, cumulative frequency
- For continuous or discrete with many values: Class intervals, midpoint, amount, frequency, cumulative amount, cumulative frequency. The number of intervals is $\sqrt{n}$ for small $n$, $\lceil\log_2(n)\rceil + 1$ for large $n$
