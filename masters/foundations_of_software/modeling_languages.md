# modeling languages

- **functions** - $f : A \to B$ a total mapping that associates an element of $A$ to a single element of $B$
- **relations** - $R \subseteq A \times B$ relates elements $A$ with $B$
- **induction** (on natural numbers) - prove $R(0)$ then prove $R(n) \implies R(n+1)$. This proves $\forall n \in \N R(n)$
- **inductively defined sets** - base cases (elements that are in $S$), inductive rules (ways to construct new elements of $S$)
- **indexed family of sets** - inductively defined sets where the inductive rules define a new set indexed by something
