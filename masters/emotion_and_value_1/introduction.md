## transformative experience

An experience is transformative iff it is both epistemically transformative and personally transformative.

- An experience is epistemically transformative if it teaches you something you could not have learned without going through that type of experience (example: seeing color or the first time)
- An experience is personally transformative if it changes you fundamentally including by impacting your core preferences (example: taking a philosophy class)

Example: all your friends are vampires. They tell you it is great. You need to decide whether you want to become one. This is a transformative choice situation.

The problem has two dimensions:

- the **experiential knowledge gap** complicates the evaluation of your options
- A **conflict between the core preferences** of your human self and those of your vampire friends is likely. Therefore, the testimony of your vampire friends might not be relevant to you.

Link between personal transformative experience and value:

1.  the close connection between preferences and values
2.  the plausible connection between identity of selves and values

Link between epistemic transformative experience and emotion:

1. the experiential dimensions of both epistemic transformative experience and emotions
2. possibly the emotions relevant to transformative experience which you may have felt

## philosophy

Philosophy is the armchair discipline

- hyper-ambitious
- self-doubting

Just like math, philosophy uses a priori knowledge (operates on an abstract world) rather than a posteriori (concludes from observations and experiments).
