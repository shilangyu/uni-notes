# values

Ways of speaking about values

- Values as abstractions ("properties") - liberty, equality, beauty
- Values as quasi-quantities - comparative
- Values as attitudes - personal. One may prioritize liberty over equality

a value has can be characterized by two quantitative criterions:

- a property F such as liberty is a positive value if the more our world contains of it the better our world is
- a property F such as alienation is a negative value if the more our world contains of it the worse our world is
