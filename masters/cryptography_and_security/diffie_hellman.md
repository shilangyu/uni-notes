# Diffie-Hellman cryptography

## key agreement

Assume a group is generated by some $g$. This $g$ is public. Actor 1 picks an $x$ at random and computes $X = g^x$ and sends it over to actor 2. Actor 2 picks $y$ at random and computes $Y = g^y$ and $K = X^y$ and sends $Y$ to actor 1. Actor 1 computes $K = Y^x$. The key is therefore $K = g^{xy}$.

The security requirement is that given $(g, g^x, g^y)$ it is hard to compute $g^{xy}$. Assuming authentication the secret key can be shared over a public channel. This is a public-key cryptography.

Example Diffie-Hellman groups:

- $Z_p^*$ (compute $g^x \bmod p$) for large primes $p$
- elliptic curves
